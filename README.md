# Java Design Patterns 🧩

## Creational Patterns 🏗️

### Singleton
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. 🌟

### Prototype
The Prototype pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. 🖨️

### Factory
The Factory pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. 🏭

### Builder
The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. 🔨

## Structural Patterns 🏗️

### Adapter
The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an interface around an existing class. 🔄

### Bridge
The Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. 🌉

### Composite
The Composite pattern composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 🌳

### Decorator
The Decorator pattern dynamically adds behavior to objects without altering their structure. 🎨

### Facade
The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system, hiding its complexity behind a single class. 🏢
